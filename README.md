# `nix` Configuration

The configuration I use for all my systems. It is based on [Dustin Lyons `nix-config`](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config), but his split for host machines didn't really work for me. I have `macOS`, `NixOS` and general Linux systems, and I wanted to make sure that this config accommodated all of them.

Currently configured systems are:

- `macbook`: Personal laptop.
- `mxw-dalco02`: Workstation used at my current employer.
- `eiger`: Private Intel Nuc. Used to host some small services.
