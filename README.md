System configuration for my computers:

- `mac`: All mac based configurations, currently only Macbook
- `work`: Configuration used at work.

- [dustinlyons/nixos-config](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config): This entire config is based on this repo. Over time quite a few changes accumulated, but without it this would have taken way longer or might have never happened.
